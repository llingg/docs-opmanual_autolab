Warning: Autolabs are still experimental. We are working on preparing a set of instructions for you but it is still all in its beta version.  


### The Big Picture {nonumber notoc}

The goal of an Autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for Duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns) to work.

An Autolab can serve different purposes. It is used for research on the Duckietown platform, and is also being used to organize the embodied challenges of [AIDO]((+AIDO#AIDO)).

The aim of this book is to present:

- a set of instructions (labeled BUILDING) on how to build an Autolab to current specifications
- a set of instructions (labeled DEMO) on how to run the Autolab functions or demos
- a set of guides (labeled SOFTWARE) to the different pieces of software that are used and are under development

### Sections

In each of the following sections you will find the BUILDING, the DEMO and the SOFTWARE pages.

You can find the up-to-date status of each page of the book at the top-right of the page, that will change as we write them down. Please only refer to those marked as either BETA or READY.

- [](#autolab-definition) : The precise definition of an Autolab
- [](#autolab-minimal-requirements) : The set of instructions to setup the minimal working environment
- [](#autolab-auto-charging) : The set of instructions to build and operate an autocharging station
- [](#autolab-localization) : The set of instruction to build and operate the localization system
- [](#autolab-operation-manual) : The set of instructions to operate the whole Autolab


Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and so the terms "Robotarium" and "Autolab" may have been used interchangeably.
